This is the introduction to my Terminal 0 to 100 series guiding you to become and expert at using
your terminal. To become and expert in a tool I believe you need to understand it under the hood.

This is where I will start.

> What is a terminal actually?

Well that is simple:

<Definition
    word="Terminal"
    type="modern"
    description="A terminal (or terminal emulator to be specific) is a graphical user interface application that provides users a command line interface to interact with the shell, similar to a console."
/>

Thank you for reading and see you in the next part: [1. Running your first commands](.).

<div class="h-[50vh] min-h-48 flex flex-col justify-around items-center print:hidden">
    <div>
        <LucideIcon icon={CircleChevronDown} class="animate-bounce"></LucideIcon>
    </div>
    <div></div>
</div>

> Hold on!

That explanation probably just raised more questions than it answered. To answer those questions
it's probably best to go all the way back to the beginning when the first computers were built.

We'll discover the origin and particularly semantic changes of these terms. Even if you know what
they mean you may still learn something interesting. Along the way I'll hopefully also provide some
motivation for why to still use a terminal. Although you probably already have reasons given you are
reading this.

## History of computers

The ENIAC (1946) was the first general purpose computer. It was programmed by setting switches and
connecting wires on the numerous panels. Card punch readers and card punch machines were used to
provide the inputs and outputs for the program.

With the release of the UNIVAC I (1951) it no longer needed to be programmed with physical switches
and wires. Instead the instructions to execute by the computer were stored in memory with the data
([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I)), an idea
introduced by John von Neumann ([wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture))
still used today.

<Definition

    type="dictionary"
    description="(noun) a panel or unit accommodating a set of controls for electronic or mechanical equipment"
/>

The panels of switches and wires was replaced with a new type of panel, the operator console. It
allowed an operator to control the computer and display the data stored in memory. The term was
based on the dictionary definition above.

Another device that was connected to computers was the teleprinter, also known as a teletypewriter,
or TTY (linux reference on hover) for short.

Initially a teleprinter could only be used to input data into the computer. Then the Whilrwind Mark
I (1955) became the first computer to be able to print output results to a teleprinter.
