## Rankings

I like ALL VOILA songs, so this is the ranking

- S: Could list to all day!
- A: Makes me feel something
- B: Great song
- C: Another song on the album
- F: Wish it wasn't in the album

## Songs

### Something Blue

A

Start of the album
Less rocky

Seeing a previous love getting married to someone else

Loved the timing of the Blue, always tried to get it right, satisfying when I did

### Caught It

C

First introduction to Chrissy Constanza?

Feel like it's missing something

About two people where for some reason it wasn't meant to be.
But when they were together, they "caught it".

### Glass Half Empty

S

The song the album is named after
Know VOILA said they felt like this encapsulated the entire album

(I just hoped that someday, someone would love me)
To me it's about not being sure what to do with your life

### Wish It On You

B

Wishing ill on someone who treated you badly

That bridge...
That change makes it stand out!

### Dead To Me

S

About when someone you loved is with someone else, they become dead to you.

A lyric I did not realise when listeneing to the song:
:o "Like cologne but the “C” is silent"

... HELLOO!!!

### We Could Be The Future

B

For some reason a song I always have to sing along to
The oohs and aahs

About just going away with someone.

### Voodoo

A

Didn't like it the first time I listened to it
Grew on me the second time

About when someone has control over you like a voodoo hearting

### Hope That I Go First

S

Not being able to live without someone

Change it tone, more ballety

### Blind Spot

B

Seeing someone from back home you were in love with and not being able to stop

### Beautiful Lie

A

Being in a relationship that is a lie

Feels like a typical VOILA song

### Petals

S

Last song of part 1

Being scared of losing your first love
Feel the emotions

### It's Got A Ring To It

B

Start of part 2, on a happy not.

Love the background vid in Spotify, black and white in all part 2

Meeting someone and being convinced you will get married.
Has an exciting vibe to it

### All Sales Are Final

F

Not my type of song, closest to F, don't like the rap and too rocky
But there are parts that I enjoy

When someone breaks your heart and your mad at them.

Not in black/white video, feels out of place in the album

### Train Of Thoughts

A

Feeling stuck and no way of escaping

Another quiet part, this time the outro, which works (but less)

### Get A Room

S

Seeing an old love who has moved on, but you haven't

Love the emotion Megan Cromwell brings

Really feels like a story.
More ballety

### Dancing On Our Graves

A

More upbeat song

About being able to dance with someone forever

Really can't stop moving when listening to the song, want to dance forever!
That trumpet!

### Ballerina

A

So many sound effects, but they add to it

Song has a slow start, but drags you in.

About not being able to talk with your partner about an issue

### School Night

A

About enjoying a night out and wanting to go back to being a kid.

That's the vibe a get, makes me take things easy.

### Straitjacket

S

"I tried to write down how I felt
But the paper stayed empty
Says it better than I could've myself"

Feeling trapped and not knowing how to move on

"You were the half of me that could've helped"

The brigde really makes me feel trapped

### Heartbreak Hotline

S

LOVE IT! First VOILA song I can imagine being played on a night out (except maybe Mamacita)

"Hey Operator I"

The Hello at the end I instantly recognized and immedietely wanted to know where it came from.
I finally found it when writing this, in Dead To Me, connecting these songs in an interesting way.

It's them picking up the phone!!! and it wasn't expected
They're trying to get in touch with the Heartbreak hotline, aren't able to
so they call the person that's dead to them :(

### WAR.

B

Wanting to do anything for that one person.

Got a great mix of happiness and sadness.

### Love Her Next

A

This takes me best to their first album!
Figure You Out vibes... The first song I heard by them.

Instructions for who will love her next, regretting the mistake

### The Autopsy of You & Me

B

They say 6 feet deep

About a love ending

### Lie with Me

S

"I want you to lie to me, lie to me
I want you to lie with me, lie with me, yeah"

Again gives me first album vibes... Right for us

### The Treasure (6 feet under)

S

If this is the last song they released I would be satisfied.
(although I wish there were enough songs to fill a whole work day)

"If X marks the spot, it's an ex with an "e""

This song would be in S if only for the bridge
```
I'm done, you're overrated // Lately
Tell me, what does it feel like? // Glass half empty
Been drinking with cupid, thinking how you've been // Cupid
Figure you out // ...
Don't say that I didn't want you // ...
Hush now, Juliet. You're nobody, nobody new // Hush now
How do you sleep at night // Cursive
When this never ends? // Glass half empty
```

When I heard the first line I was like OMG,
then there came more

## Conclusion

I'm not a big lyrics person
Almost all songs make me feel what the lyrics are saying without listening to them
