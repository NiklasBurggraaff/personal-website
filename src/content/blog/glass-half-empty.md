title: Glass Half Empty Tier-List
description: Ranking the VOILÁ songs in their two-part album
pubDate: 2024-11-22
---

VOILÁ have become my favorite band the past few years.
They are the first artist I regularly listened to their full albums, loving all the songs.
Particularly after their "The Cure for Breathing" album came out last year,
I was hooked on the album.

This was the first year where I was anticipating any of their releases.
They released many songs from this album as singles, building the anticipation.

Finally part 2 of the album came out today.
I thought it would be fun to create a tier-list.
Particularly as I'm going to their concert with Chrissy Constanza tomorrow!

## Rankings

Just to give you an idea, this is what the different ranks mean.
Keeping in mind I like ALL VOILÁ songs.

- S: Could list to all day!
- A: Makes me feel something
- B: Great song
- C: Contributes to the album
- F: Wish it wasn't in the album

## Part 1

### Something Blue

Starting with Something Blue.
The first of the singles they released and the first song on the album.

From the start I really enjoyed the chorus.
I particularly loved the timing of the "blue" just being slightly different.
This made it really satisfying when getting the timing right.

This song feels less rocky than their previous album and think that set
the tone for the rest of the album.

Solid start, putting it straight into

A

### Caught It

This song was my first introduction to Chrissy Constanza, who will be at their concert tomorrow.

About two people where for some reason it wasn't meant to be.
But when they were together, they "caught it".

Unfortunately this songs feels like it is missing something.
I still really enjoy it, but I feel like I cannot feel the song.
This is something I can with almost all other songs.

Although this song introduces me to Chrissy Constanza, it's still just a

C

### Glass Half Empty

Here is the song the album is named after, and the first song not released as a single.

The first time I listened to the song I had mixed feelings.
But it quickly grew on me and I understand why VOILÁ said they felt like this encapsulated the entire album.

The song feels a bit more similar to the songs in their previous album.
Being quite rocky and sad, but for some reason those are the songs I like the most.

I could definitely listen to this song all day, so it's the first one that goes into

S

### Wish It On You

This song is followed by one of the other more rocky songs in the album.

This song is completely carried by THAT bridge.
In the middle of the rock song there is a soft vocal part with a piano.

Without the bridge it would be the same tier as Caught It.
But that bridge makes it stand out making it

B

### Dead To Me

Next, Dead To Me brought me back to their Happy Never After album.
It's the exact style of song that they have made my favorite.
Pop-rock is the best way I found to describe it.

When looking at the lyrics I found one of my favorite lines that I didn't notice when listening to it:
"Like cologne but the “C” is silent".

It also contains a line that I will come back to later, "... Hello".

This is the kind of song that made me love VOILÁ and I'm still loving it, so

S

### We Could Be The Future

This is a song that for some reason I always have to sing along to.
Particularly with the oohs and aahs after each chorus.

Even with this, I just don't feel the song so it goes into

B

### Voodoo

This was another song that I didn't like the first time I listened to it.
But again it really grew on me the second time.

The song is about someone having control over you like a voodoo.

I really enjoy the feel of the song, with the flow and the instrumentals.
Because of this it goes into

A

### Hope That I Go First

This song is a big change it tone. It's more of a ballad.
This brings me back to their Long Story Short album.
It had the songs I first listened to by VOILÁ.

Like Dead to Me, it brings me back to the VOILÁ songs that made me fall in love with them.
For that reason it's definitely

S

### Blind Spot

"You are my blind spot on memory lane". That is really what this song is about.
It's back to a more rocky song.

Another line I really like about the song is:
"I know that it's careless but I couldn't care less".

I really enjoy this song, but it isn't anything special so it goes into

B

Seeing someone from back home you were in love with and not being able to stop

### Beautiful Lie

This song is more towards pop on the pop-rock slider of VOILÁ songs.
I really enjoy the start of the chorus, which makes me really want to sing along.

It's about a relationship being an act.

For me this is a typical VOILÁ song, that makes me feel something so the definition of

A

### Petals

This is the last song of part 1.
When I first heard this song I didn't think much of it.
But for some reason it was the one that stayed in my head after listening to part 1.

It's about being scared of losing your first love.
"Happy endings are just stories that haven't ended yet".
I can really feel the emotions in the song.
I also really enjoy the contrasts they create between the versus and the chorus,
with the instrumentals getting much more prominent.

I probably just played this song in my head for a whole day so definitely

S

## Part 2

### It's Got A Ring To It

B

Start of part 2, on a happy not.

Love the background vid in Spotify, black and white in all part 2

Meeting someone and being convinced you will get married.
Has an exciting vibe to it

### All Sales Are Final

F

Not my type of song, closest to F, don't like the rap and too rocky
But there are parts that I enjoy

When someone breaks your heart and your mad at them.

Not in black/white video, feels out of place in the album

### Train Of Thoughts

A

Feeling stuck and no way of escaping

Another quiet part, this time the outro, which works (but less)

### Get A Room

S

Seeing an old love who has moved on, but you haven't

Love the emotion Megan Cromwell brings

Really feels like a story.
More ballety

### Dancing On Our Graves

A

More upbeat song

About being able to dance with someone forever

Really can't stop moving when listening to the song, want to dance forever!
That trumpet!

### Ballerina

A

So many sound effects, but they add to it

Song has a slow start, but drags you in.

About not being able to talk with your partner about an issue

### School Night

A

About enjoying a night out and wanting to go back to being a kid.

That's the vibe a get, makes me take things easy.

### Straitjacket

S

"I tried to write down how I felt
But the paper stayed empty
Says it better than I could've myself"

Feeling trapped and not knowing how to move on

"You were the half of me that could've helped"

The brigde really makes me feel trapped

### Heartbreak Hotline

S

LOVE IT! First VOILA song I can imagine being played on a night out (except maybe Mamacita)

"Hey Operator I"

The Hello at the end I instantly recognized and immedietely wanted to know where it came from.
I finally found it when writing this, in Dead To Me, connecting these songs in an interesting way.

It's them picking up the phone!!! and it wasn't expected
They're trying to get in touch with the Heartbreak hotline, aren't able to
so they call the person that's dead to them :(

### WAR.

B

Wanting to do anything for that one person.

Got a great mix of happiness and sadness.

### Love Her Next

A

This takes me best to their first album!
Figure You Out vibes... The first song I heard by them.

Instructions for who will love her next, regretting the mistake

### The Autopsy of You & Me

B

They say 6 feet deep

About a love ending

### Lie with Me

S

"I want you to lie to me, lie to me
I want you to lie with me, lie with me, yeah"

Again gives me first album vibes... Right for us

### The Treasure (6 feet under)

S

If this is the last song they released I would be satisfied.
(although I wish there were enough songs to fill a whole work day)

"If X marks the spot, it's an ex with an "e""

This song would be in S if only for the bridge
```
I'm done, you're overrated // Lately
Tell me, what does it feel like? // Glass half empty
Been drinking with cupid, thinking how you've been // Cupid
Figure you out // ...
Don't say that I didn't want you // ...
Hush now, Juliet. You're nobody, nobody new // Hush now
How do you sleep at night // Cursive
When this never ends? // Glass half empty
```

When I heard the first line I was like OMG,
then there came more

## Conclusion

I'm not a big lyrics person
Almost all songs make me feel what the lyrics are saying without listening to them
