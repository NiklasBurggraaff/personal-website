Happy birthday to me 🎉!

This year I decided to set goals for myself to complete by my next birthday.
This is my first year working full-time and living on my own (without flatmates).
These goals will hopefully guide me to have a great year!

I've laid out my goals in the following way:

0. Goal: Should be measurable
  - 🌱 Starting progress: Where I am today
  - 📝 Plan: How I will achieve the goal
  - 📈 Current progress: Will update this every month to track progress

I split the goals into 4 main categories:
personal projects, financial, physical, and other.

## Personal Projects

These are some goals for personal, technical projects.
Some of these I have wanted to do for a while and now I want to make the time for them.

  - 🌱 None uploaded, have many ideas and started practicing editing
  - 📝 Upload a new video each month

As I'm starting my first full-time job I want to start putting myself in a
great financial situation from the beginning.

9. Save <redacted> amount of money
  - 🌱 None, as is from income this year
  - 📝 Save a tenth of this amount every month

## Physical

The initial reason for making these goals was watching a lot of fitness videos.
I'm looking to regularly go to the gym for the first time
(apart from when I did for a bit before I was 18),
alongside running regularly.

I've split the physical category into 3 sub-categories: calories in, strength, and endurance.

### Calories in

  - 🌱 Just completed a cut (86kg -> 82kg) mainly by tracking calories which taught me a lot
  - 📝 Bulk Sep, Oct, Nov; maintain Dec; cut Jan; bulk Feb, Mar, Apr; maintain May; cut Jun
  - 📈 -
11. Summer maintanance
  - 🌱 N/A
  - 📝 Cut in June (and potentially July) then maintain to be in great shape over summer
  - 📈 -

### Strength

These goals are based on [Jeff Niffard beginner level](https://youtu.be/LrDJXIQ_-eg?si=WfByl_W4UgChFt3e).
The current progress is based on having gone to the gym for the first time again this week.
